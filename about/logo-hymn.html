<p>The STEFTI logo is depicted
by a red rose near a flame
amidst a background of blue.</p>
 
<p>St. Therese promised:
“After my death, I will let fall
a shower of roses”.
The rose represents
all her acts of love,
done in her “little way”.
This is the spirituality of
St. Therese of the Child Jesus.
This, too, is the reason why the school
is named after St. Therese.
We believe  that holiness is within the reach
of every man, woman, and child
as they offer the daily ordinary tasks
lovingly to the Lord.</p>
 
<p>The flame stands for the fire of the Holy Spirit
whose guidance and inspiration
we humbly pray for, as well as
the light of knowledge.
Through our academic programs
may we in our own small way help
to dispel the darkness of ignorance.</p>
 
<p>The green leaf is a symbol of ever-growing life.
We pray that the school will always be receptive
to ideas and fresh innovations.</p>
 
<p>The blue background stands for heaven -
our ultimate goal.
May heaven smile kindly on our efforts.</p>
