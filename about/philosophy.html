        <li>that Christian education is most needed in Philippine society and therefore all educational efforts should be based on this fundamental tenet;</li>
        <li>that academic excellence as well as total development should be consciously and consistently woven into every effort of the school;</li>
        <li>that the school should be a dynamic contributor in producing literate, productive, useful, patriotic and upright citizens and that literacy should embrace at least basic and moral enlightenment in numeracy and science;</li>
        <li>that the school should be an agent of the preservation and improvement of the desirable aspects of Filipino culture;</li>
        <li>that the home is a potent partner of the school in the education of the children;</li>
        <li>that the entire school campus and its physical components like the classrooms, halls, corridors, library and other study areas compose one dynamic, cohesive and convergent learning center and that the educational community, which includes the officers, teachers, administrative-supervisory and support personnel, pupils, parents and guardians and even the members of the Cornerstone Faith Community, constitute a vibrant learning society and God’s household – all contributing to the development and formation of the pupils and democratic living; and</li>
        <li>that the school is a living organic unit operant and attuned to contemporary developments and trends in science and technology, including human development and instructional technology, and accepted practices of Christian formation on the gospel values.</li>
