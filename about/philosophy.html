        <li>That <strong>Christian education</strong> is most needed in Philippine society and therefore all educational efforts should be based on this fundamental tenet;</li>
        <li>That <strong>academic excellence as well as total development</strong> should be consciously and consistently woven into every effort of the school;</li>
        <li>That the school should be a <strong>dynamic contributor in producing literate, productive, useful, patriotic and upright citizens</strong> and that literacy should embrace at least <strong>basic and moral enlightenment</strong> in numeracy and science;</li>
        <li>That the school should be an agent of the <strong>preservation and improvement of the desirable aspects</strong> of Filipino culture;</li>
        <li>That the home is a <strong>potent partner of the school in the education</strong> of the children;</li>
        <li>That the entire school campus and its physical components like the classrooms, halls, corridors, library and other study areas compose one <strong>dynamic, cohesive and convergent learning center</strong> and that the educational community, which includes the officers, teachers, administrative-supervisory and support personnel, pupils, parents and guardians and even the members of the Cornerstone Faith Community, <strong>constitute a vibrant learning society</strong> and God’s household – all contributing to the development and formation of the pupils and democratic living; and</li>
        <li>That the school is a living organic unit operant and attuned to <strong>contemporary developments and trends in science and technology</strong>, including human development and instructional technology, and accepted <strong>practices of Christian formation on the gospel values</strong>.</li>
